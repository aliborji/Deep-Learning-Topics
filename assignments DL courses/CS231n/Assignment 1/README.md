CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Assignment Solutions)
===========

So far, this is Stanford's most popular class on Deep Learning. There is a total of 16 lectures focusing on deep learning for image classification. It addresses topics including motivation, history, concepts and architectures focusing on image classification using deep learning. The instructors are Fei-Fei Li, J [**Fei-Fei Li**](http://vision.stanford.edu/feifeili/), [**Justin Johnson**](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/) and [**Serena Yeung**](http://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/) (Spring 2017).

The official course website is http://cs231n.stanford.edu/

In this repository I added my solutions for the course assignments (Spring 2017). I did not enroll in Stanford course, I just watched the lectures offered online, which is public and everyone can have access.

If you prefer to download the lectures instead of watching them online, the video files and lecture slides are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-BNKfjyEnVAMXAxdU85VG56Zjg).

I do not guarantee the correctness of my solutions. Therefore if you find any errors, please let me know! :) 

The completed assignments are marked as **[##Done!##]**, otherwise they are as originally downloaded from the [course site](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) and marked as **[##Pending!##]**.
